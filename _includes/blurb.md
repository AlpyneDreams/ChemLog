ChemLog is an app that can help you record your drug, research chemical, nootropic use, as well as provide curated information on substances; all for the purpose of harm-reduction. ChemLog's design is inspired by [KnowDrugs](https://knowdrugs.app/) and [ChemDiary](https://chemdiary.com/), but open source, well-maintained, highly polished, privacy-first, and always free.

We source much of our substance data from [TripSit Factsheets](https://drugs.tripsit.me/) and [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Main_Page).
