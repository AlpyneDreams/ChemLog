Track your drug, reaserach chemical, nootropic, and substance use.

## About

ChemLog is an app to help you record your drug, research chemical, nootropic use, and create trip reports; all for the purpose of harm-reduction. ChemLog's design is heavily inspired by [ChemDiary](https://chemdiary.com/) and [KnowDrugs](https://knowdrugs.app/), but built to be open source, with the intent to produce a well-maintained, highly polished, privacy-first, always free app.

We source much of our substance data from [TripSit Factsheets](https://drugs.tripsit.me/) and [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Main_Page).
